## **Overview**

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goal of this project is to create an app that would enable students and faculty of The University of Hawaii at Manoa campus to easily search for places to eat, based on their cravings for the day, for example, if the user want to grab a coffee in the morning the user can search within the app and the app would show all the available coffee shops within the campus, or if the user wants to have a healthy meal replacement smoothie for lunch, the user would be able to search for that as well, and lastly, if the user wants to have pizza for dinner they would be able to locate a place that serves pizza for dinner. The app would also empower the user to find out what specific days a favorite dish of theirs is being served at a specific restaurant of their choosing. The app would also enable the user to do the following within the app:
</p>
* Allow the user to log in using their UH credentials
* Show specific menu items available at the current time and show the locations of those places.
* Show general menus available throughout the day on any specific day.
* Be able to check what forms of payment the location accepts(i.e. Apple pay, UH dining credits, AMEX.)


## **Approach** 

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The app should be able to provide a landing page in which an image would show a potential highlight of a specific restaurant for the day. The app would also provide a navigation bar at the top of the landing page in where it would show the organizations logo at the top left of the screen and the center screen would provide the navigation around the website and lastly on the far top right of the screen would show social media links and login information and/or option. The Navigation bar would display links to restaurants, food trucks, and other food options around the campus. In the end the app layout would have all the following information:
</p>
* Landing Page (Restaurant Highlight)
* User Home Page / Profile
* Vendor Home Page / Profile
* Admin Home Page
* Add Vendor Page
* Link to Vendors HomePage Via Navigation Bar
* Food Availability
* Food Searches
<p align="justify">
The app would then also contain a footer menu in which it would display a contact us, about us, and so forth.
</p>

## **Use Case Ideas**

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.</p>

* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
* New vendor goes to landing page, logs in, gets  home page, sets up profile.
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, looks for food to buy.
* Vendor, goes to landing page, logs in, edits online store.
* User is notified of daily menu changes and food items that matches their preferences.

## **Beyond The Basics**

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
* Notify students via email, twitter, SMS when particular food choices are available.
* Automated updating of menu items from vendors. For example, they agree to post their daily specials via twitter, and your application retrieves their twitter feed and uses that data to update their page.
* Allow students to rate menu items.
* Integrated map functionality; note that some food trucks change their location over the course of a week.
* Provide feed of tweets from vendors (some vendors might use Twitter to advertise daily specials and locations.)
